# Tagger
###### Isn't it sad that Linux computers—unlike Macs—cannot add tags to files? Without tags, sorting and finding your files is much harder. Tagger is an extremely lightweight Python-based terminal tool, for very basic file/folder sorting, built specifically for Raspberry Pis.

## Usage

Tagger has a subcommand system, making it intuitive to use, and much more similar to spoken language than using flags:
```bash
$ tagger list tag Home
$ tagger rename Home "Home and Work"
$ tagger tag example.txt "Home and Work"
```
